# Week 1

### [Report](https://github.com/IanRiera/MCV-M4-3D-Vision/blob/master/image_rectification/M4_Lab1_Team7.pdf)

In this project, planar transformations and rectifications are applied to some of the images of the EPFL-Stretcha dataset. 

The code is presented in the Jupyter Notebook **lab1.ipynb**. 

## Task 1: Image Transformations
* Similarity
* Affinities
* Homographies

## Task 2: Affine Rectification
* Remove projective distortions

## Task 3: Metric Rectification
* Recover metric proportions of an image

## Task 4 (Optional): Metric Rectification on a Single Step
* Rectify an image on a single step, as an alternative to the stratified method
