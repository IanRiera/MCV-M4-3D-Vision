# Week 3

### [Report](https://github.com/IanRiera/MCV-M4-3D-Vision/blob/master/fundamental_matrix_applications/M4_Lab3_Team7.pdf)

In this project, the fundamental matrix (F) relating two different views of a scene is estimated both with the normalized 8-point algorithm (algebraic method) and the robust normalized 8-point algorithm using RANSAC. Finally, we test these algorithms in a real application, which is a simplification of the Photo-sequencing method by T. Dekel (Basha) et al.

The code is presented in the Jupyter Notebook **lab3-team7.ipynb**. 

## Task 1: Fundamental Matrix Estimation
* Normalized 8-point algorithm
* Robust normalized 8-point algorithm
* Epipolar lines

## Task 2: Application - Photo-sequencing
* Estimate the different locations of a dynamic object on a reference image
